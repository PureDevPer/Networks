# Link State Routing Protocol Algorithm

- A link-state routing protocol is performed by every switching node in the network. 
- The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs a map of the connectivity to the network, in the form of a graph, showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes.
-  Each node then independently calculates the next best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network. 
- The collection of best paths will then form the nodeâ€™s routing table.
