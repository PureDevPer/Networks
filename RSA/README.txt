How to execute RSA program

Enter the menu number
	1. Make prime number
	2. Check prime number
	3. Make Keypair and then encrypt, decrypt
	4. End of the program


- If you choose 1,
	You should enter the bit number to return a prime number.
	After you enter the bit number, you can find random prime number and the time it takes to create a prime number.

- If you choose 2,
	You should enter the number to check prime number.
	If you write a prime number, you will return a 'true'.
	If not, you will return a 'false'.

- If you choose 3,
	You should enter the two numbers to make a public key and a private key.
	After you enter the first number, Press enter button, and then Write the second number.
	If you enter the number, you can find a public key pair and a private key pair.
	Next, Enter the number you want to encrypt.
	Finally, Enter the the number you want to decrypt.

- If you choose 4,
	the RSA program terminates.
